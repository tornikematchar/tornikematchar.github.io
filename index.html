        WITHCRAFT THROUGH THE AGES
    </h1>
    <p>
        Witchcraft, traditionally, the exercise or invocation of alleged <a
            href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/supernaturalism">supernatural</a> powers to control people or
        events, practices typically involving sorcery or magic. Although defined differently in disparate historical and
        cultural contexts, witchcraft has often been seen, especially in the West, as the work of crones who meet
        secretly at night, indulge in cannibalism and orgiastic rites with the Devil, or Satan, and perform black magic.
        <br>
        Witchcraft thus defined exists more in the imagination of contemporaries than in any objective reality. Yet this
        stereotype has a long history and has constituted for many cultures a viable explanation of evil in the world.
        <br>
        The intensity of these beliefs is best represented by the European witch hunts of the 14th to 18th century, but
        witchcraft and its associated ideas are never far from the surface of popular consciousness and—sustained by
        folk tales—find explicit focus from time to time in popular television and films and in fiction.

    <h2>MEANINGS</h2>
</div>
<div>
    <p> The modern English word witchcraft has three principal connotations: the practice of magic or sorcery worldwide;
        the beliefs associated with the Western witch hunts of the 14th to the 18th century; and varieties of the modern
        movement called Wicca, frequently mispronounced “wikka.”</p>
</div>

<div>
    <p> The terms witchcraft and witch derive from Old English wiccecraeft: from wicca (masculine) or wicce (feminine),
        pronounced “witchah” and “witchuh,” respectively, denoting someone who practices sorcery; and from craeft
        meaning “craft” or “skill.” <br> Roughly equivalent words in other European languages—such as sorcellerie
        (French),
        Hexerei (German), stregoneria (Italian), and brujería (Spanish)—have different connotations, and none precisely
        translates another. The difficulty is even greater with the relevant words in African, Asian, and other
        languages. The problem of defining witchcraft is made more difficult because the concepts underlying these words
        also change according to time and place, sometimes radically. Moreover, different cultures do not share a
        coherent pattern of witchcraft beliefs, which often blend other concepts such as magic, sorcery, religion,
        folklore, theology, technology, and diabolism. Some societies regard a witch as a person with inherent
        supernatural powers, but in the West witchcraft has been more commonly believed to be an ordinary person’s free
        choice to learn and practice magic with the help of the supernatural. <br> (The terms West and Western in this
        article refer to European societies themselves and to post-Columbian societies influenced by European concepts.)
        The answer to the old question “Are there such things as witches?” therefore depends upon individual belief and
        upon definition, and no single definition exists. <br> One thing is certain: the emphasis on the witch in art,
        literature, theatre, and film has little relation to external reality.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <p> alse ideas about witchcraft and the witch hunts persist today. First, the witch hunts did not occur in the
        Middle Ages but in what historians call the “early modern” period (the late 14th to the early 18th century), the
        era of the Renaissance, the Reformation, and the Scientific Revolution. <br> There was neither a witch-cult nor
        any
        cult, either organized or disorganized, of a “Horned God” or of any “Goddess”; <br> Western “witches” were not
        members of an ancient pagan religion; and they were not healers or midwives. Moreover, not all persons accused
        of witchcraft were women, let alone old women; indeed, there were “witches” of all ages and sexes. <br> Witches
        were
        not a persecuted minority, because witches did not exist: the people hurt or killed in the hunts were not
        witches but victims forced by their persecutors into a category that in reality included no one.</p>


    <p> The witch hunts did not prosecute, let alone execute, millions; they were not a conspiracy by males, priests,
        judges, doctors, or inquisitors against members of an old religion or any other real group. <br> “Black masses”
        are
        almost entirely a fantasy of modern writers. “Witch doctors,” whose job it was to release people from evil
        spells, seldom existed in the West, largely because even helpful magic was attributed to demons.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3>SORCERY</h3>
</div>
<div>
    <p>A sorcerer, magician, or “witch” attempts to influence the surrounding world through occult (i.e., hidden, as
        opposed to open and observable) means. <br> In Western society until the 14th century, “witchcraft” had more in
        common with <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/sorcery"> sorcery<a/> in other cultures—such as those of
            India or Africa—than it did with the witchcraft of the
            witch hunts. <br> Before the 14th century, witchcraft was much alike in villages from Ireland to Russia and
            from
            Sweden to Sicily; however, the similarities derived neither from cultural diffusion nor from any secret cult
            but
            from the age-old human desire to achieve one’s purposes whether by open or occult means.
    </p>

    <p>In many ways, like their counterparts worldwide, early Western sorcerers and witches worked secretly for private
        ends, as contrasted with the public practice of religion. <br> Witches or sorcerers were usually feared as well
        as
        respected, and they used a variety of means to attempt to achieve their goals, including incantations (formulas
        or chants invoking evil spirits), divination and oracles (to predict the future), amulets and charms (to ward
        off hostile spirits and harmful events), potions or salves, and dolls or other figures (to represent their
        enemies). Witches sought to gain or preserve health, to acquire or retain property, to protect against natural
        disasters or evil spirits, to help friends, and to seek revenge. <br> Sometimes this magic was believed to work
        through simple causation as a form of technology. <br>For example, it was believed that a field’s fertility
        could be
        increased by ritually slaughtering an animal. Often the magic was instead an effort to construct symbolic
        reality. <br> Sorcery was sometimes believed to rely on the power of gods or other spirits, leading to the
        belief
        that witches used demons in their work. </p>

    <h4>THE WITCH HUNT</h4>
</div>
<div>
    <p> Although <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/witch-hunt"></a> <a>accusations</a> of witchcraft in contemporary
        cultures provide a means to express or resolve social
        tensions, these accusations had different consequences in premodern Western society where the mixture of
        irrational fear and a persecuting mentality led to the emergence of the witch hunts. In the 11th century
        attitudes toward witchcraft and sorcery began to change, a process that would radically transform the Western
        perception of witchcraft and associate it with heresy and the Devil.
    <p/>
    <p>By the 14th century, fear of heresy and of Satan had added charges of diabolism to the usual indictment of
        witches, maleficium (malevolent sorcery). It was this combination of sorcery and its association with the Devil
        that made Western witchcraft unique. <br>From the 14th through the 18th century, witches were believed to
        repudiate
        Jesus Christ, to worship the Devil and make pacts with him (selling one’s soul in exchange for Satan’s
        assistance), to employ demons to accomplish magical deeds, and to desecrate the crucifix and the consecrated
        bread and wine of the Eucharist (Holy Communion). <br> It was also believed that they rode through the air at
        night
        to “sabbats” (secret meetings), where they engaged in sexual orgies and even had sex with Satan; that they
        changed shapes (from human to animal or from one human form to another); </p>
